* (Auth) fixed [issue 84](https://github.com/myflashlab/Firebase-ANE/issues/84)
* (Analytics) Firebase team fixed [issue 34](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios/issues/34) and we made sure it is also working on the ANE side.
* (Analytics) Added [getAppInstanceID](http://myflashlab.github.io/asdoc/com/myflashlab/air/extensions/firebase/analytics/FirebaseAnalytics.html#getAppInstanceID())
* (DB) fixed [issue 65](https://github.com/myflashlab/Firebase-ANE/issues/65)
* (DB) fixed setValue and updateChilderen methods so they are now correctly removing values at targetted references if you are sending an empty String ```""``` at those references.
* (FCM) You can now use the [Resource Manager Software](http://www.myflashlabs.com/adobe-air-native-extension-resources-project/) to add custom icons for notifications on the Android side. *iOS shows app icon only. Firebase does not support this*
* (FCM) You can create custom [.caf files](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22.caf%22+files&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab) for iOS notifications to play custom sounds when a notification arrives.
* (FCM) known issue: custom sounds for Android must be placed in the res/raw folder using the [Resource Manager Software](http://www.myflashlabs.com/adobe-air-native-extension-resources-project/) but unfortunately this is not working because it seems like AIR is somehow compressing the files inside the raw folder. We will bring this issue to Adobe's attention so maybe they can fix this problem.  
* Minor bug fixes on the ANE side.
* With upgrading to the latest Firebase SDK, a lot of native bugs are also fixed. You can learn about them by checking the official native Firebase [release notes](https://firebase.google.com/support/releases).

*Jan 14, 2017 - V3.0.0*
* Firebase Core ANE needs the ```appinvite``` dependency also from now on.
* You will need AIR SDK 24 or higher to compile Firebase ANEs. Older SDKs are just too old to support Firebase from mow on.
* firebaseDynamicLinks.ane has been added and works on both Android and iOS. To make sure it works correctly, you need to initialize dynamicLinks as soon as possible in your app, right after you initialized the Core Firebase ANE. ```Firebase.init(true);```
* ```FirebaseConfig``` now has two getter/setter properties (```projectID``` and ```webApiKey```) which can be used for accessing dynamicLinks REST API.
* [Firebase.init](http://myflashlab.github.io/asdoc/com/myflashlab/air/extensions/firebase/core/Firebase.html#init()) accepts a boolean which is set to ```false``` by default. If set to ```true```, the ANE will be prepared to use DynamicLinks.
* ```FirebaseEvents``` has been introduced which notifies you when GoogleApiClient is connected or disconnected. You may find these events helpful only on the Android side when working with DynamicLinks. These events will not be dispatched at all when you're running on iOS.
* If you are going to add DynamicLinks to your project, read the Wiki and make sure you are generating new provision files for iOS. Your old provisions will not work with DynamicLinks.

*Nov 27, 2016 - V2.0.0*
